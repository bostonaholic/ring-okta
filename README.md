### Okta SAML Toolkit Dependency

Since Okta doesn't publish the SAML Toolkit for Java, you must download it [here](https://support.okta.com/entries/25009573-Current-SAML-Toolkit-for-Java-Version). You then must `mvn install` it to your local maven repository. Check the [project.clj](./project.clj) for the version of the SAML Toolkit to download from Okta.

## Usage

```
(ns com.company.core
  (:require [compojure.core :refer :all]
            [compojure.route :as route]
            [ring.middleware.okta :refer [wrap-okta okta-routes]]))

(defroutes company-routes
  (GET "/" [] "<h1>Hello World</h1>")

  okta-routes

  (route/not-found "<h1>Page not found</h1>"))

(def app
  (-> company-routes
      (wrap-okta "https://company.okta.com")))
```
